<p><h4><b><em>&emsp;&emsp;The Perhentian Islands (Malay: Kepulauan Perhentian) are islands in Besut District, Terengganu, Malaysia.

The two main islands are Perhentian Besar ("Greater Perhentian") and Perhentian Kecil ("Lesser Perhentian"). The small, uninhabited islands of Susu Dara (Virgin Milk), Serengeh and Rawa lie off Kecil.

Like Besut, people here generally speak Kelantanese Malay, however English is widely spoken and understood to accommodate the growing tourism market. The Perhentian Islands have become a popular travel destination for families and backpackers alike due to the many lodging options that accommodate almost any budget.</em></b></h4></p>

<p><h4><b><em>&emsp;&emsp;Nature tourism provides the economic base for the islands. Both the islands have palm-fringed white coral sand beaches (that can be tough on the feet) and turquoise blue sea. Popular tourist activities include scuba-diving, snorkeling, and swimming. On most beaches, the water is shallow with many rays, cuttlefish and parrotfish. For diving, there are dozens of dive sites around both main islands, as well as several off-shore sites. Apart from these, activities like camping, canoeing, fishing, jungle trekking, and banana boat riding are also available.</em></b></h4></p>
<li><h3><ins>Climate</ins></h3></li>
<p><h4><b><em>&emsp;&emsp;The Perhentian islands experience a heavy monsoon season between November and February, and most of the islands are essentially closed off to tourists. Resorts and ferry services are stopped during this time due to the weather but there is still a boat service daily to serve the fishermen village at Pulau Perhentian Kecil. On average each year, the Perhentian Islands receive over 100 inches of rain and experiences roughly 12 daylight hours on average.

<li><h3><ins>Turtle conservation</ins></h3></li>
<p><h4><b><em>&emsp;&emsp;The Perhentian Islands were once home to a significant green and hawksbill sea turtle nesting population. The Department of Fisheries runs a turtle hatchery on the islands to help address the declining turtle populations. Egg poaching from the beaches is a continuing problem.</em></b></h4></p>
